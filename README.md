## Header
+ I applied a background image to the webpage, ensuring it fits the screen appropriately. By using CSS, I positioned the background image to the center and set its height to 200 pixels. Additionally, I utilized the 'background-size' property to ensure the image adjusts to fit the screen seamlessly.

##body
+  I utilized the 'box-sizing' property to control the sizing behavior of the webpage elements. Subsequently, I set the width of the content to 80% and centered it on the screen by applying 'margin: auto'. This adjustment maintains the element's size while ensuring it's horizontally centered. Additionally, I incorporated a background color of 'smoke white' to enhance the visual appeal of the webpage.
